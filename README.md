# Useless Reverb

This is a simple reverb VST effect written in C++ with the JUCE framework and based on Geraint Luff's ADC21 talk "Let's Write a Reverb": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZK2Goiyotk

You may compile and use it if you so choose, but it currently does not sound particularily pleasing yet. I'm working on it though. I mainly use this project to learn more about DSP and get used to working with JUCE.
